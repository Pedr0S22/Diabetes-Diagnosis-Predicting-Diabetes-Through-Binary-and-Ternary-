# Diabetes Diagnosis - Predicting Diabetes Through Binary and Ternary Classification Approaches

## Project Overview

This project utilizes two preprocessed datasets, made available by [Alex Teboul](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset). The original data is sourced from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 survey and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system).

The datasets include responses from 253,680 U.S. adults, with 21 features related to demographics, lifestyle, and health indicators. These features are used to classify individuals as either:

- **Healthy** or **Diabetic** (binary classification dataset)
- **Healthy**, **Prediabetic**, or **Diabetic** (ternary classification dataset)

The primary distinction between the two datasets is the target labels, which vary depending on the classification type.
